Marc Marquez Alenta (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time, with eight Grand Prix world championships to his name – six of which are in the premier MotoGP class. Márquez races for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013. He is nicknamed the 'Ant of Cervera' worldwide and 'el tro de Cervera' in his hometown, meaning the 'Thunder of Cervera'. He is one of four riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood, Phil Read and Valentino Rossi. Márquez is often considered one of the greatest innovators of modern MotoGP racing,[1][2] due to his comparatively exaggerated cornering technique of leaning so far over the bike he seems to be "in constant danger of sliding out". He is also the youngest ever champion in MotoGP history.
